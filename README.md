# NGinxModulesCompiler
A script to compile NGinx Modules by @FoxieFlakey and @Fjox

It is expected that you already have NGinx installed and are running as root.

run this command to start the script (later you only need the last part.)
``` wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Foxtanium/NGinxModulesCompiler/main/compilemodule.sh && chmod +x compilemodule.sh && ./compilemodule.sh```
